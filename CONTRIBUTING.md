# Contributing to AB Spectrum Engineering

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AB Spectrum's mission of improving autism therapy through data-driven solutions! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively to our healthcare technology projects.

## 🎯 Mission Alignment

Before contributing, please understand that all our engineering efforts are focused on:
- Improving therapy outcomes for children with autism
- Enhancing clinical decision-making through data analytics
- Streamlining therapeutic workflows for better efficiency
- Advancing evidence-based ABA practices through technology

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of HIPAA compliance requirements
- Familiarity with autism spectrum disorders and ABA therapy (or willingness to learn)
- Proficiency in relevant technologies (Python, SQL, ML frameworks, etc.)
- Commitment to ethical healthcare technology development

### First-Time Contributors
1. **Read our documentation**: Start with the project README and clinical context
2. **Review our Code of Conduct**: Understand our community standards
3. **Join our Slack workspace**: Connect with the team for onboarding
4. **Complete HIPAA training**: Required for all contributors (link provided after team invitation)
5. **Look for "good first issue" labels**: Start with beginner-friendly tasks

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance
- **Never commit PHI**: All patient data must be anonymized or synthetic
- **Use secure channels**: Discuss sensitive topics only in approved channels
- **Follow data handling procedures**: Use our approved data access methods
- **Report security concerns immediately**: Contact security@abspectrum.org

### Data Security Guidelines
```bash
# ✅ Good: Using anonymized data
patient_id = "anon_001"
session_data = {"duration": 45, "progress_score": 0.85}

# ❌ Bad: Actual patient information
patient_name = "John Smith"  # Never do this
```

## 🏗️ Development Process

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for new features
- `feature/[name]`: Individual feature development
- `hotfix/[name]`: Critical production fixes

### Workflow
1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Create a feature branch** from `develop`
3. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
4. **Write/update tests** with minimum 85% coverage
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Submit a pull request** with detailed clinical context

### Code Standards

#### Python
```python
# Use type hints
def calculate_progress_score(session_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
    """Calculate therapy progress score based on session data.

    Args:
        session_data: Dictionary containing session metrics

    Returns:
        Progress score between 0.0 and 1.0

    Raises:
        ValueError: If session_data is invalid
    """
    pass
```

#### SQL
```sql
-- Use descriptive names and comments
SELECT
    patient_id,
    session_date,
    AVG(progress_score) AS avg_progress,  -- Weekly progress average
    COUNT(*) AS session_count
FROM therapy_sessions
WHERE session_date >= DATEADD(week, -1, GETDATE())
GROUP BY patient_id, session_date;
```

#### Documentation
- All functions must have docstrings
- Clinical context required for therapeutic algorithms
- API changes need updated OpenAPI specs
- Database changes require migration documentation

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- **Minimum 85% code coverage** for all new code
- **100% coverage** for clinical decision algorithms
- **Integration tests** for data pipelines
- **End-to-end tests** for critical clinical workflows

### Test Types
```python
# Unit test example
def test_progress_calculation():
    """Test progress score calculation with various inputs."""
    session_data = {"correct_responses": 8, "total_trials": 10}
    score = calculate_progress_score(session_data)
    assert 0.0 <= score <= 1.0
    assert score == 0.8

# Integration test example
def test_data_pipeline_integrity():
    """Test that data flows correctly through pipeline."""
    # Test with synthetic data only
    pass
```

### Data Testing
- **Schema validation**: Ensure data conforms to expected schemas
- **Quality checks**: Test for completeness, accuracy, consistency
- **Performance tests**: Validate query performance with large datasets
- **Privacy tests**: Verify no PHI is exposed in logs or outputs

## 📊 Data & Analytics Contributions

### Machine Learning
- **Model validation**: Cross-validation with clinical oversight
- **Bias detection**: Test for algorithmic bias across demographics
- **Interpretability**: Ensure models are explainable to clinicians
- **Performance tracking**: Monitor model performance in production

### Data Pipeline
- **Idempotency**: Ensure pipelines can be safely re-run
- **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and alerting
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of data quality issues
- **Scalability**: Design for growing data volumes

### Analytics
- **Clinical relevance**: Ensure metrics align with therapeutic goals
- **Statistical rigor**: Use appropriate statistical methods
- **Visualization**: Create clear, actionable dashboards
- **Documentation**: Explain analytical approaches to clinical staff
